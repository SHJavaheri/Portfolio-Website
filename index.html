                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a passionate <b>Computer/Software Engineer</b> with a deep interest in Machine Learning, AI, and Database Systems, I am dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge
                    technology to solve complex problems. My career ambition is to contribute to a major technology company, where I can make a meaningful impact, and eventually,
                    to establish and lead my own company, shaping the future of innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My life outside of work is equally vibrant and diverse. I have a profound love for music, which includes both playing various instruments and exploring different genres.
                    Photography and videography are hobbies that allow me to capture and appreciate the beauty of the world around me. My athletic pursuits are extensive, ranging from advanced
                    MMA martial arts to swimming, volleyball, and soccer, reflecting my commitment to physical fitness and teamwork. Additionally, I enjoy cooking, which provides a creative outlet
                    and a way to unwind. Staying organized and multitasking are essential skills I apply in both my personal and professional life, while gaming and group interactions offer
                    enjoyable ways to relax and connect with others. These varied interests not only enrich my life but also enhance my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
