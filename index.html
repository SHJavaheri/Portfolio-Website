                        Experience seamless music control with our sleek Spotify Music Player for desktop.<br>
                        Positioned at the top left, it displays track details and provides easy access<br>
                        to play/pause, skip, volume, and seek functions. The interface fades out when not in use<br>
                        and reappears with a hover or shortcut.

                    <p>
                        Hello! This Minecraft mod is an addon to the game as a personal project for myself.<br>
                        The mod contains several ideas that I've had over time, and decided to add to the game. As time goes on,<br>
                        I will be updating the mod over and over, to live up to its name, 'Infinite Expansion". I hope you enjoy!
                    </p>
